please check "ux design - images" and "Logo" folder for all Skapp design work done so far. I have been working on concept, design and features coding for couple of months.
I am actively working on incorporating UX changes as per Adobe Design files and making changes in Skynet AppStore. Adobe files along with html/css will be opensourced along with beta release (Early Dec).

Skapp-alpha will be released in couple of days.
